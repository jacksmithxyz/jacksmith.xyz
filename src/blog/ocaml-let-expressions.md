title: "OCaml let expressions"

I've been learning about `let` expressions in OCaml, which are not a complex concept but I'm definitely having trouble wrapping my head around them completely. 

Instead of a standard `let` definition, e.g. 
```ocaml
let x = 5
``` 

You can do something like this:

```ocaml
let x = 5 in x + 1
```

This `in` keyword basically functions like "in this scope".

This means for with the second piece of code for example, if after this you decided to convert x into a string with something like:

```ocaml
string_of_int x
```

You would get an error like `Error: Unbound value x`.

This is because these `let` expressions only bind the value within a specified scope. 

I'm trying to determine the exact use cases for these, and I imagine it's for intermediate values where you want to name a value for clarity, and are using these values to compose some other value to be returned. But I'm still not entirely sure yet.
