For the last few years or so, I've been working in the wonderful world of web development.

I don't mean this in a sarcastic manner either; the web is probably my favourite platform. No walled gardens - write HTML/CSS/JS, and push it to a server.

I've always enjoyed putting things on the screen, as well as working with data and doing backend shenanigans.

But what I don't enjoy about the state of modern frontend development is the sheer amount of convolutedness, and the large amount of glue engineering which I end up doing.

It feels like I spend half my time fixing package conflicts, trying to work out how to do *X* in *Y* framework, and connecting one API to another API. Some of this work can be fun, and it of course serves the primary purpose of creating business value. There isn't any issue with it.

But I do ask myself: is this really what I want to do?

Do I want to be gluing different APIs together, and working out why this version of a package doesn't work with another one? Or learning a framework, which is essentially just a DSL, and have to re-learn the new spec every time it gets changed?

The answer is, of course, no. But the bigger problem is to do with **learning**.

The TLDR is that I like to learn new things. I want to do work where learning new things involves solving domain problems, or becoming a better programmer, rather than "learning" how a new framework functions. It feels like I'm not really learning anything real.

## Why not PHP/Elixir/Ruby/insert other non-JS framework here?

The simple answer is that I want something new, with different challenges to solve. I've been looking for the area of programming that can "nerd-snipe" me like some other areas have.

The things I've been building I barely felt I've learnt anything substantial when it comes to domain knowledge. So here's to a different personal journey.

## Venturing into a new niche

Weirdly, I've not picked a specific niche or domain at the moment yet. I find that sometimes just taking a look at a few different areas at a surface-level can you help you understand what you really want to do.

What I'm largely going to be exploring are developer tools, and systems programming.

Developer tooling is quite a interesting niche, as being a developer I can try and create tools which solve my own problems.

The second area is systems programming. I feel that I don't know enough about how computers work (and I probably should).

## Conclusion and final thoughts

Really I want to do good work, build interesting and cool software, write about it, and use any combination of these skills to make it as an indie. This is a lot to ask for, I'm aware, but hey, you gotta try and do things.

Thanks for reading!
