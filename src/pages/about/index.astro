            <p>
                Hello, I'm Jack. I am software developer from the UK. I enjoy
                writing and building web applications, from design all the way
                to the backend and hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My path into tech is an unconventional one. I've worn many hats
                and done a lot of different things. My <a
                    class="text-blue-500 underline">blog</a
                > documents some of my buildings and learnings.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the things I've done professionally:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                <li>
                    Built production web applications, solo and within small
                    teams
                </li>
                <li>Collaborated with designers, developers, and animators</li>
                <li>
                    Maintained open source developer documentation with 80K+
                    page views
                </li>
                <li>Created tutorials for TypeScript SDKs</li>
                <li>Built Telegram bots</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated developer and technical writer, and take a
                passionate and pragmatic approach to my work.
            </p>

            When I'm not at the keyboard
        </h3>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or writing, I like to spend time with my wife,
            ride my fixed gear bike, or enjoy nature.
